                <h2>Why Love Your Body?</h2>
                <p>
                    Your body is your home — the only one you truly have for life. It carries you through every day, lets you feel the warmth of the sun, dance to your favorite music, and hug the people you love. It may not look like the images we see in magazines or online, but that’s okay — because real beauty isn't about perfection.</p>

                <p>
                     Loving your body means being kind to yourself, appreciating what your body does for you, and knowing you are worthy no matter your size, shape, or scars. It’s about treating yourself with respect and understanding that your value isn’t measured by numbers or opinions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your body is unique. It's strong in its own way. It's part of your story — and that alone makes it worth loving.

                <h2>Why Body Diversity Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Body diversity matters because every body deserves to be seen, respected, and celebrated — just as it is. People come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and abilities, and that diversity is natural, beautiful, and important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we only promote one type of body as "ideal," we send the message that others are less worthy — and that’s simply not true. Body diversity reminds us that health, beauty, and value are not one-size-fits-all. It challenges harmful stereotypes and opens space for representation, inclusion, and self-acceptance.
                </p>
                <p>By embracing body diversity, we create a world where everyone feels safe and confident to show up as themselves. It's not just about appearance — it's about human dignity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because every body is a good body!

                People in larger bodies can be healthy. People in smaller bodies can struggle. Health is complex—it lives in your habits, your mindset, your heart. Not just your pants size.
                Fit, Fat, and Fun – Lets Change the Conversation. I believe in movement, strength, and joy. I believe in being active because it feels amazing—not because you need to “fix” your body.
                I believe in fit, fat, and fun—because you can be all three, and still be wildly healthy and completely worthy.

            <h4>A Gentle Reminder</h4>
            <p>
                You dont need permission to love yourself now.
                Not “after I lose weight.”
                Not “when I look like her.”
                Now. As you are.
            </p>

        <p>Youre not broken. Youre a whole, beautiful work-in-progress.</p>
        <p>Lets celebrate all bodies. Lets chase health, not perfection.</p>
        <p>Lets create a space where everyone feels welcome—because your body is worthy of love, respect, and care. Always.</p>
